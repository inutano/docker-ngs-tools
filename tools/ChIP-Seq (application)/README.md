# ChIP-Seq (application)

The ChIP-Seq web server provides access to a set of useful tools performing common ChIP-Seq data analysis tasks, including positional correlation analysis, peak detection, and genome partitioning into signal-rich and signal-poor regions. It is an open system designed to allow interoperability with other resources, in particular the motif discovery programs from the Signal Search Analysis (SSA) server.
