# DeconSeq

DeconSeq can be used to automatically detect and efficiently remove any type of  sequence contamination from metagenomic datasets, including human or other host sequences. The tool uses a modified version of the BWA-SW aligner and can be applied to longer-read datasets (150+bp read length). DeconSeq is available as both standalone and web-based versions.
