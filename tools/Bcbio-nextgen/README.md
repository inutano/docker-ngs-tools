# Bcbio-nextgen

Python scripts and modules for automated next gen sequencing analysis. These provide a fully automated pipeline for taking sequencing results from an Illumina sequencer, converting them to standard Fastq format, aligning to a reference genome, doing SNP calling, and producing a summary PDF of results.
