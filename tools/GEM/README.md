# GEM

GEM is a java software tool to analyze transcription factor binding ChIP-Seq/ChIP-exo data. It predicts binding events, performs de novo motif discovery and use the motif to improve the binding event calling. It calls binding events right at (or very close to ) the motif positions,  deconvolves closely spaced homotypic binding events and accurately discovers binding motifs.
