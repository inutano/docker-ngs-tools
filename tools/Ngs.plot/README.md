# Ngs.plot

ngs.plot is a program that allows you to easily visualize your next-generation sequencing (NGS) samples at functional genomic regions. The signature advantage of ngs.plot is that it collects a large database of functional elements for many genomes. A user can ask for a functionally important region to be displayed in one command. It handles large sequencing data efficiently and has only modest memory requirement. A web-based version (integrated into Galaxy) is also available for the ones who are allergic to terminals.
