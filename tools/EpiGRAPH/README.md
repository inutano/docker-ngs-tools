# EpiGRAPH

EpiGRAPH enables biologists to analyze genome and epigenome datasets with powerful statistical and machine learning methods. In a typical workflow, the user uploads a set of genomic regions of interest (e.g. experimentally mapped enhancers, hotspots of epigenetic regulation or sites exhibiting disease-specific alterations), and EpiGRAPH searches a large database of (epi-) genomic attributes for significant overlap and correlation with the regions in the input dataset. Furthermore, EpiGRAPH can predict the status of genomic regions that were not included in the input dataset.
