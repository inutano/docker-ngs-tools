# Gnumap

The Genomic Next-generation Universal MAPper (gnumap) is a program designed to accurately map sequence data obtained from next-generation sequencing machines (specifically that of Solexa/Illumina) back to a genome of any size. Currently, gnumap is designed to be used with the _int.txt data received from the Solexa/Illumina machine.
