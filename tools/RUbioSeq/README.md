# RUbioSeq

RUbioSeq has been developed to facilitate the primary and secondary analysis of resequencing projects by providing an integrated software suite of parallelized pipelines to detect exome variants (SNVs and CNVs) and to perform Bisulfite-seq analyses automatically. RUbioSeq's variant analysis results have been already validated and published. AVAILABILITY: http://rubioseq.sourceforge.net/
