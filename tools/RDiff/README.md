# RDiff

rDiff is an open source tool for accurate detection of differential RNA processing from RNA-Seq data. It implements two statistical tests to detect changes of the RNA processing between two samples. rDiff.parametric is a powerful test, which can be applied for well annotated organisms to detect changes in the relative abundance of isoforms. rDiff.nonparametric is an alternative when the annotation is incomplete or missing.
