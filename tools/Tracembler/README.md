# Tracembler

Tracembler streamlines the process of recursive database searches, sequence assembly, and gene identification in resulting contigs in attempts to identify homologous loci of genes of interest in species with emerging whole genome shotgun reads. A web server hosting Tracembler is provided at http://www.plantgdb.org/tool/tracembler/, and the software is also freely available from the authors for local installations.
