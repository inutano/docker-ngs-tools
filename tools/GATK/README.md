# GATK

The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) is a structured programming framework designed to enable rapid development of efficient and robust analysis tools for next-generation DNA sequencers. The GATK solves the data management challenge by separating data access patterns from analysis algorithms, using the functional programming philosophy of Map/Reduce
