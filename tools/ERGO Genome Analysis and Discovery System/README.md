# ERGO Genome Analysis and Discovery System

ERGO provides a systems-biology informatics toolkit centered on comparative genomics to capture, query and visualize sequenced genomes. Building upon the most comprehensive genomic database available anywhere integrated with the largest collection of microbial metabolic and non-metabolic pathways and using Igenbio's proprietary algorithms, ERGO assigns functions to genes, integrates genes into pathways, and identifies previously unknown or mischaracterized genes, cryptic pathways and gene products.
