Ridom SeqSphere+ Software is designed for distributed work-groups (client/server model) and allows automatic processing, assembling and analyzing of NGS (e.g., Illumina, Ion Torrent or PacBio) and Sanger capillary-electrophoresis sequence data. SeqSphere+ is the solution for easy and automated microbial analysis; enabling your lab to employ whole genome microbial typing (cgMLST or MLST+), traditional MLST or eMLST/rMLST sequencing projects.
