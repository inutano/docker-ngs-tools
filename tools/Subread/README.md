# Subread

Subread is a general-purpose read aligner which can be used to map both genomic DNA-seq reads and RNA-seq reads. It uses a new mapping paradigm called "seed-and-vote" to achieve fast, accurate and scalable read mapping. It automatically determines if a read should be globally or locally aligned, therefore particularly powerful in mapping RNA-seq reads. It supports indel detection and can map reads with both fixed and variable lengths.
