# MethylCoder

Pipeline for fast, simple processing of BiSulfite-treated reads into methylation data. Includes scripts for analysis and visualization. In addition to a binary output, the direct output of methylcoder is a text file that indicates per-nucleotide methylation context (CG/CHG/CHH) and methylation levels (both coverage and C-T conversions)
