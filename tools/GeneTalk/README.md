# GeneTalk

GeneTalk, a web-based platform, that can filter, reduce and prioritize human sequence variants from NGS data and assist in the time consuming and costly interpretation of personal variants in clinical context. It serves as an expert exchange platform for clinicians and scientists who are searching for information about specific sequence variants and connects them to share and exchange expertise on variants that are potentially disease-relevant.
