# Tripal

Tripal is a collection of open-source, freely-available Drupal modules that serves as a web interface for a GMOD Chado database. It is designed to allow anyone with genomic data to quickly create an online genomic database using community supported tools. Tripal is part of the open-source tool collection available through the Generic Model Organism Database (GMOD) project.
