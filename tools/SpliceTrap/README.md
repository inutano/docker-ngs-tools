# SpliceTrap

SpliceTrap is a statistic tool for quantifying exon inclusion ratios in paired-end RNA-seq data. Instead of full transcript quantification, SpliceTrap approaches to exon inclusion level estimation as a Bayesian inference problem. For every exon it quantifies the extent to which it is included, skipped or subjected to size variations due to alternative 3’/5’ splice sites or Intron Retention.
