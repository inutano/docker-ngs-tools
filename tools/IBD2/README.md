# IBD2

Our algorithm uses a non-homogeneous hidden Markov model (HMM) that employs local recombination rates to identify chromosomal regions that are identical by descent (IBD=2) in children of consanguineous or non-consanguineous parents solely based on genotype data of siblings derived from high-throughput sequencing platforms.
