# Post Assembly Genome Improvement Toolkit

" Tools to generate automatically high quality sequence by ordering contigs, closing gaps, correcting sequence errors and transferring annotation.
With the advent of next generation sequencing a lot of effort was put into developing software for mapping or aligning short reads and performing genome assembly. For genome assembly the problem of generating a draft assembly (i.e. a set of unordered contigs) has now been very well addressed - but for users who need high quality assemblies for their analyses there are still unresolved issues: this is where PAGIT is used.
