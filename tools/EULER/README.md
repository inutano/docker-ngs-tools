# EULER

EULER-SR is a program for de novo assembly of reads. Contrary to the overlap-layout approach, EULER-SR uses a de Bruijn graph to construct an assembly. The assembly of a genome corresponds to an Eulerian path in the de Bruijn graph. Long (possibly erroneous) reads, and mate-pairs are used to determine parts of the correct Eulerian traversal in the assembly.
