# EdgeR

edgeR is an R/Bioconductor software package for statistical analysis of replicated count data. Methods are designed for assessing differential expression in comparative RNA-Seq experiments, but are generally applicable to count data from other genome-scale platforms (ChIP-Seq, MeDIP-Seq, Tag-Seq, SAGE-Seq etc).
