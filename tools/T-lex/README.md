# T-lex

Here, we present a computational pipeline (T-lex) that uses NGS data to detect the presence/absence of annotated Transposable Element (TE) copies. T-lex can use data from a large number of strains and returns estimates of population frequencies of individual TE insertions in a reasonable time.
