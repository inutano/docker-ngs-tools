# CEQer

CEQer (Comparative Exome Quantification analyzer) is a graphical, event-driven tool for copy number abnormalities/allelic-imbalance coupled analysis of whole-exome sequencing data. By using case-control matched exome data, CEQer performs a comparative digital exonic quantification to generate CNA data and couples this information with exome-wide LOH and allelic imbalance detection.
