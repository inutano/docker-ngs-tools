# GenoREAD

GenoREAD is a web-based, sequence verification software that can be used to compare Sanger sequencing trace files against a reference sequence.  Users can either submit their sequencing results one clone at a time, or they can submit a series of clones (as a project) to run at once.  Results can be viewed online or downloaded.
