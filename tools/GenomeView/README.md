# GenomeView

GenomeView is a next-generation stand-alone genome browser and editor initiated in the BSB group at VIB and currently developed at Broad Institute. It provides interactive visualization of sequences, annotation, multiple alignments, syntenic mappings, short read alignments and more. Many standard file formats are supported and new functionality can be added using a plugin system.
