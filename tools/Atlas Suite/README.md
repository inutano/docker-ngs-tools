# Atlas Suite

Atlas is a suite of variant analysis tools specializing in the separation of true SNPs and insertions and deletions (indels) from sequencing and mapping errors in Whole Exome Capture Sequecing (WECS) data. SNPs may be called using the Atlas-SNP2 application and indels may be called using the Atlas-Indel2 application.
