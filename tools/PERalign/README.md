# PERalign

A probabilistic framework is described to predict the alignment to the genome of all paired-end read transcript fragments in a paired-end read dataset. Starting from possible exonic and spliced alignments of all end reads, our method constructs potential splicing paths connecting paired ends. An expectation maximization method assigns likelihood values to all splice junctions and assigns the most probable alignment for each transcript fragment.
