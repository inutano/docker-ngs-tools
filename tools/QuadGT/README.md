# QuadGT

QuadGT is a software package for calling single-nucleotide variants in four sequenced genomes: normal-tumor pairs coupled with parents. Genotypes are inferred using a joint model of parental variant frequencies, de novo germline mutations, and somatic mutations. The model quantifies the descent-by-modification relationships between the unknown genotypes by using a set of parameters in a Bayesian inference setting.
