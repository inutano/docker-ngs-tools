# NGSView

High-throughput sequencing technologies introduce novel demands on tools available for data analysis. We have developed NGSView, a generally applicable, flexible and extensible next-generation sequence alignment editor. The software allows for visualization and manipulation of millions of sequences simultaneously on a desktop computer, through a graphical interface. NGSView is available under an open source license and can be extended through a well documented API.
