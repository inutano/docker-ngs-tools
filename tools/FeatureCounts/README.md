# FeatureCounts

featureCounts is a very efficient read quantifier. It can be used to summarize RNA-seq reads and gDNA-seq reads to a variety of genomic features such as genes, exons, promoters, gene bodies and genomic bins. It is included in the Bioconductor Rsubread package and also in the SourceForge Subread package.
