# Diffreps

diffReps is developed to find different peaks in ChIP-seq. It scans the whole genome using a sliding window, performing millions of statistical tests and report the significant hits. diffReps takes into account the biological variations within a group of samples and uses that information to enhance the statistical power. Considering biological variation is of high importance, especiallly for in vivo brain tissues.
