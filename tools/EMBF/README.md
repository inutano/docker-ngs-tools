# EMBF

Frequency-based, de novo short-read clustering method that organizes erroneous short sequences originating in a single abundant sequence into a tree structure; in this structure, each “child” sequence is considered to be stochastically derived from its more abundant “parent” sequence with one mutation through sequencing errors.
