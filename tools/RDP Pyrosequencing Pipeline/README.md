# RDP Pyrosequencing Pipeline

The Ribosomal Database Project's Pyrosequencing Pipeline aims to simplify the processing of large 16s rRNA sequence libraries obtained through pyrosequencing. This site processes and converts the data to formats suitable for common ecological and statistical packages such as SPADE, EstimateS, and R.
