# ERDS

ERDS is a free, open-source software, designed for detection of copy number variants (CNVs) on human genomes from next generation sequence data. It uses paired Hidden Markov models (PHMM) based on the expected distribution of read depth of short reads and the presence of heterozygous sites. ERDS is NOT good for whole exome data.
