# Cortex

Cortex is an efficient and low-memory software framework for analysis of genomes using sequence data. Cortex allows de novo assembly of variants without having to do a consensus assembly first. Also allows comparison of genomes without using consensus, and alignment of sequence data to a de Bruijn graph
