# R2R

R2R is a simple to use package for very sensitive analysis of short read sequence data obtained by NextGen sequencing techniques. R2R was developed in conjunction with data obtained on the Illumina GA platforms. R2R is written in simple Perl script and runs equally well under MS Windows, Mac OS and Linux/Unix operative systems.
