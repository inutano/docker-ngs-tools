# Bis-SNP

BisSNP is a package based on the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) map-reduce framework for genotyping in bisulfite treated massively parallel sequencing (Bisulfite-seq, NOMe-seq and RRBS) on Illumina platform. It uses bayesian inference with either manually specified or automatically estimated methylation probabilities of different cytosine context(not only CpG, CHH, CHG in Bisulfite-seq, but also GCH et.al. in other bisulfite treated sequencing) to determine genotypes and methylation levels simultaneously.
