It quickly became apparent that this was an inefficient manner to work, so we started assembling smaller utilities that could be adapted into larger, more complicated, workflows. We have used them for Illumia, SOLiD and 454 sequencing data. We have used them for DNA and RNA resequcing, ChIP-Seq, CLIP-Seq, and targeted resequencing (Agilent exome capture and PCR targeting). These tools are also used heavily in our in-house DNA and RNA mapping pipelines.\nThese tools have of great use within our lab group, and so we are happy to make them available to the greater community.\nNGSUtils is made up of 50+ programs, mainly written in Python.

The expression level given by these technologies is the number of reads in the library mapping to a given feature (gene, exon, transcript, etc.), i.e., the read counts. Most of the statistical methods for assessment of differential expression using count data rely on parametric assumptions about the distribution of the counts (Poisson, Negative Binomial, \u2026). Moreover, many of them need replicates to work and tend to have problems to evaluate differential expression in features with low counts.\nNOISeq is a non-parametric approach for the identification of differentially expressed genes from count data. NOISeq empirically models the noise distribution of count changes by contrasting fold-change differences (M) and absolute expression differences (D) for all the features in samples within the same condition. This reference distribution is then used to assess whether the M-D values computed between two conditions for a given gene is likely to be part of the noise or represent a true differential expression.\nThe are two variants of the method: NOISeq-real uses replicates, when available, to compute the noise distribution and, NOISeq-sim simulates them in absence of replication. It should be noted that the NOISeq-sim simulation procedure assimilates to technical replication and does not reproduce biological variability, which is necessary for population inferential analysis."],
